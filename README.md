In our study, we utilized Python programming language and data analysis techniques to investigate the dynamic interplay between hurricanes and surface water salinity levels. We accessed salinity data from the USGS website and imported it into a .csv file for analysis. Using JupyterLab with the Pandas extension, we cleaned and manipulated the data, focusing on daily values of salinity to provide granularity in our analysis. We resampled the data to target specific frequencies and identified dates corresponding to the landfall of Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole.

Our analysis revealed distinct patterns in salinity dynamics in response to each hurricane event. For Hurricane Nicole, which made landfall near Miami, we observed an initial decline in salinity due to heavy freshwater rainfall, followed by a significant increase in salinity as the salt-laden storm surge traversed across the state. In contrast, Hurricane Ian, making landfall west of Fort Myers, exhibited a spike in salinity prior to landfall, attributed to the arrival of the storm surge, followed by a decline correlated with heavy freshwater rainfall in the outer bands of the hurricane.

Importantly, both hurricanes occurred during high tide, magnifying their impact on coastal inundation and saltwater intrusion. These findings underscore the complex interactions between meteorological phenomena, storm dynamics, and coastal hydrology, highlighting the need for comprehensive disaster preparedness and adaptive management strategies in vulnerable coastal regions.
